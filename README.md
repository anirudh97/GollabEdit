# GollabEdit
This project is a self-initiated endeavor to learn Go programming and the concept of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) in distributed computing. The primary aim is to create the backend for a real-time, collaborative text editor.

## Overview
The project is designed to provide a hands-on experience with Go and CRDTs, focusing on their application in real-time, distributed systems. The backend developed in this project supports a real-time text editor that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously without conflicts.

In addition to the backend for the text editor, the project also includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) component. This CLI allows users to interact with the application, supporting operations such as user creation, login, logout, and file operations like create, open, and share.

## Future Work
The project is a continuous learning journey, and there are plans for future enhancements:

- Develop UI for the editor: The current project focuses on the backend, and the next step is to develop a user-friendly interface for the text editor.
- Breakdown the CLI part to align with microservice architecture: The CLI component will be refactored to align with the principles of microservice architecture, improving the modularity and scalability of the application.
- Deploy the application in containers: To ensure the application is easy to deploy and scale, future work will involve containerizing the application, likely using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

## Learning Journey
This project is a testament to the learning journey in Go programming and distributed computing concepts like CRDTs. It serves as a practical application of these technologies and concepts, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and learning.
